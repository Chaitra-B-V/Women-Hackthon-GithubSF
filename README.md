# SightPal

 A Companion for the visually impaired!

Just access the webpage, record a video, and use it to help make everyday decisions. 


**Why did we pick this?**


According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 2.2 billion people globally have a vision impairment or blindness. This accounts for roughly 26.2% of the global population. 
However, it’s important to note that a majority of people (including people our age) are likely to develop some kind of visual impairment or blindness in their lifetime. Thus, it is important to start planning for products that can make life easier in the long term. 



**Why video instead of images?**

To provide the visually impaired a richer experience of the world! Images often don’t provide dense information to the user to make certain decisions- sometime this could be critical, such as assessing if there is a safety concern around.


This product can help with everyday decisions, ranging from:
Does this outfit work? 
To
Am I in an unsafe situation right now?
